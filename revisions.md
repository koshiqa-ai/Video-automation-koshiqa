## 2026-10-29 · HV-StartSteps + system · Storyboard-driven videos with real screenshots
- **Asked:** the flow is screen recording → HTML storyboard with screenshots (reference: "How to Start Steps") → design.md layouts → Remotion video; voiceover comes from the team.
- **Changed:**
  - Phone can show real screenshots (`screen: { image, w, h, taps }`, taps in image px; `atWord` syncs a tap or annotation to a spoken word). The recording's status bar and red timer are replaced by a clean 9:41 bar.
  - New scripts: `recording-frames.py` (distinct screens from a recording), `redact.py`, `make-storyboard.py` (review HTML in the reference format), `storyboard-import.py` (HTML → screenshots + JSON), `vo-split.py` (one full VO file → one clip per slide).
  - New video `src/videos/start-steps.ts` from the imported storyboard; `storyboards/README.md`.
  - `design.md` 1.1: real screenshots, T1/T2 only for 2–3 steps (S2 + card headline otherwise), longer walkthroughs allowed, no peek when the target spans both bottom corners.
- **Why / decisions:**
  - No T1/T2: the storyboard has 8 sections and no line for a steps list.
  - Beat #04's line said "jump to row #15" (flagged in the storyboard). Placeholder wording: "…just open it and skip ahead to connecting Koshiqa." **Needs the team's final line.**
  - Beat #11 stays cut. Slide 16 has no peek (the highlighted email row spans both corners).
  - Runtime 1:46 with placeholder VO: longer than the 30–40 s guideline, kept as an approved setup walkthrough.
  - Tested: recording-frames found all 16 screens in a rebuilt recording; vo-split cut a 17-line VO correctly; the storyboard round trip (JSON → HTML → JSON) is lossless.
- **Output:** `out/HV-StartSteps.mp4` (placeholder Piper VO), `out/HV-StartSteps-qa.png`. Open: UI-copy flags #01/#03 are for the app team.

## 2026-10-29 · system · Script-to-video pipeline + Help Video skill
- **Asked:** a skill that makes help videos from `design.md` and the Remotion project, plus this revisions log.
- **Changed:** added `src/videos/` (spec types, builder, registry, `SCREENS.md`, example `join-contest.ts`), `src/HelpVideo.tsx`, `scripts/help-video-vo.ts`, `scripts/help-video-qa.ts`, `scripts/qa-sheet.py`. `src/LayoutSystem.tsx`: code tags can be turned off and annotation timing (`anno.at`) is configurable. `src/data/layout-system.ts`: sound cues shared via `cuesFor()`. Registered help videos in `Root.tsx`.
- **Why / decisions:** a video is a list of design.md layout codes, so the skill can't invent layouts. Slide length = 0.35 s lead + voiceover + 0.45 s tail. The example's success beat moved from S3 to S2 because S3 crops the top of the screen where "You're in!" appears (caught by the QA sheet).
- **Output:** `HV-JoinContest` (25 s, placeholder Piper English VO).

## 2026-10-29 · system · Initial baseline
- **Changed:** design system v1.0 (`design.md` + `design/`), approved layout system, flat Torty, Soft UI SFX, earlier explorations kept for reference.
